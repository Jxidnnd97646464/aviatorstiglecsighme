desktop to access the 1Win mobile site.

the page, and find the link to the iOS app. By clicking on this button,
you will be able to set up quick access to the web app for smartphones.

## Aviator game guide

The Aviator game is simple to play. Here are the basic rules:

1.  Before starting the game, the player has to choose the amount of bet
    he is willing to make. It is possible to place two bets per round
    ranging from INR 7 to 7,000. Bets can be placed automatically.
2.  The game has a multiplier that determines the player's winnings.
    This multiplier depends on how long the plane flies and can range
    from x1 to x100.
3.  Once a bet has been made, you must wait for a new round -- your bet
    will come into play. During the game, you're asked to keep an eye on
    the multiplier -- the player needs to leave the game when the
    multiplier is satisfying him, but it's also important to do so
    before the end of the round.
4.  If he gets out before the round is over, his bet will be multiplied
    by the multiplier (that was on the screen when he got out), and he
    will get the winnings.
5.  If the player doesn't manage to get out of the game before the end
    of the round, the whole amount of the user's bet will be lost.
